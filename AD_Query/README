Alzheimer's Disease Gene Query Program
Author: Galil Gertner
Date: 3.22.17

Requirments:

This program uses the following:
    - Cassandra
    - neo4j (neo4j-driver)
    - mySQL
    - etree

Goal:
    To find and create the correct database for each of the input files and
    data types.

Tasks:
    1. Create a database for all of the gene values for a sample of
       patients on the scale of no alzheimers disease to full alzheimers
       disease, and create the ability for the user to query the mean
       values for those genes and standard deviation from the mean
       among the sample patients.
    2. Create a database of the patients, their age, sex, and level
       of education.
    3. Create a database detailing all of the gene's relations to other genes.
    4. Create a database detailing all of the information we know of a
       particular gene.

Synopsis:

    1. Created and functional. I chose to use cassandra for the database
       because it can
       accomodate that many columns.
       In order to access the information given in the ROSMAP file as a
    2. I loaded this into a classic SQL database because it seems to fit the
       mold, but I did not get to provide query functionality yet.
    3. I have created a python script that can load all of the relations in
       the BIOGRID map exceptionally fast -- in under a minute into neo4j
       detailing the relations between the genes, but I have yet
       to to create the query classes correctly.
    4. I though this model would work exceptionally well as a mongoDB
       collection The information is not normalized, therefore a
       traditional SQL table is a poor choice.  Also, it is in XML
       format, for which there are standard conversions to JSON.
       Once it is in JSON format, it is already in mongo format.
       I have not made any progress in creating this database aside
       from deciding which one is appropriate for it.
